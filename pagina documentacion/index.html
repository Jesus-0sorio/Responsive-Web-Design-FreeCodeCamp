            Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming
            language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the
            use of significant indentation.

            Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports
            multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly
            procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often
            described as a "batteries included" language due to its
            comprehensive standard library.

              <h3>Alternate Implementations</h3>
              <p>
                Though there is one Python implementation which is by far the
                most popular, there are some alternate implementations which are
                of particular interest to different audiences.
              </p>
              <p>Known implementations include:</p>

            A Python program is read by a parser. Input to the parser is a
            stream of tokens, generated by the lexical analyzer. This chapter
            describes how the lexical analyzer breaks a file into tokens.

            Python reads program text as Unicode code points; the encoding of a
            source file can be given by an encoding declaration and defaults to
            UTF-8, see PEP 3120 for details. If the source file cannot be
            decoded, a SyntaxError is raised.

            Objects are Python’s abstraction for data. All data in a Python
            program is represented by objects or by relations between objects.
            (In a sense, and in conformance to Von Neumann’s model of a “stored
            program computer”, code is also represented by objects.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Every object has an identity, a type and a value. An object’s
            identity never changes once it has been created; you may think of it
            as the object’s address in memory. The ‘is’ operator compares the
            identity of two objects; the id() function returns an integer
            representing its identity.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>CPython implementation detail:</strong> For CPython,
            <code>id(x)</code> is the memory address where x is stored.

            A Python program is constructed from code blocks. A block is a piece
            of Python program text that is executed as a unit. The following are
            blocks: a module, a function body, and a class definition. Each
            command typed interactively is a block. A script file (a file given
            as standard input to the interpreter or specified as a command line
            argument to the interpreter) is a code block. A script command (a
            command specified on the interpreter command line with the -c
            option) is a code block. A module run as a top level script (as
            module <code>__main__</code>) from the command line using a -m
            argument is also a code block. The string argument passed to the
            built-in functions eval() and exec() is a code block.
          </p>
          <p>
            A code block is executed in an execution frame. A frame contains
            some administrative information (used for debugging) and determines
            where and how execution continues after the code block’s execution
            has completed.

            Python code in one module gains access to the code in another module
            by the process of importing it. The import statement is the most
            common way of invoking the import machinery, but it is not the only
            way. Functions such as <code>importlib.import_module()</code> and
            built-in <code>__import__()</code> can also be used to invoke the
            import machinery.
          </p>
          <p>
            The import statement combines two operations; it searches for the
            named module, then it binds the results of that search to a name in
            the local scope. The search operation of the import statement is
            defined as a call to the __import__() function, with the appropriate
            arguments. The return value of __import__() is used to perform the
            name binding operation of the import statement. See the import
            statement for the exact details of that name binding operation.
