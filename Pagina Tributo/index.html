        <h2>Who Alan Turing was:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician,
            cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist.
          </li>
          <li>
            Received his Ph.D. from the Department of Mathematics at Princeton
            University.
          </li>
          <li>
            During World War II, he worked for the British code-breaking center
            that produced Ultra intelligence.
          </li>
          <li>
            For a time he led Hut 8, the section that was responsible for German
            naval cryptanalysis.
          </li>
          <li>
            He devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of
            German ciphers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Turing played a crucial role in deciphering the intercepted coded
            messages.
          </li>
          <li>
            Worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the
            Automatic Computing Engine (ACE), one of the first designs for a
            stored-program computer.
          </li>
          <li>In 2019, was voted the greatest person of the 20th century.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="phrase">
          "A computer can be called "intelligent" if it manages to fool a person
          into thinking it is a human."
